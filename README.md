# Fairy #

The scripts I ever programmed are just like little fairies who get jobs done magically. May you feel helpful with them. 

## Facilities ##

Programming a robust Bash script is usually non-trivial. Fortunately, you can refer to [`bash_bootstrap.sh`](_template/bash_bootstrap.sh) to bootstrap you Bash script in a right shape. Moreover, you may also leverage `bin/bootstrap_sh` to further ease the bootstrapping. (See the quick two-step setup [here](bin/README.md))
